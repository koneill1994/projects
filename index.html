<h2> Research Projects </h2>
<ul>
	<li>
		<b>NLP Dashboard of COVID-19 Research Literature</b>
		<p> As part of the summer of Topological Data Analysis 2020, with the AFRL 711th Human Performance Wing,
		I and my team utilized Natural Language Processing techniques to create a dashboard that allows users to quickly visualize
		the existing research on coronaviruses, and search the literature against input queries and hypotheses.  
		</p>
		<p>
		The <a href="https://www.kaggle.com/allen-institute-for-ai/CORD-19-research-challenge">COVID-19 Open Research Dataset</a> is a large corpus (>200,000 documents) of 
		articles which have been published on coronaviruses, with specific focus on research relating to COVID-19.  We utilized NLP analysis techniques such as 
		<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tf%E2%80%93idf">tf-idf</a>, word and sentence embeddings such as <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/FastText">fastText</a>,
		<a href="https://github.com/allenai/scibert">SciBERT</a>, and <a href="https://github.com/dmis-lab/biobert">BioBERT</a>, and dimensionality reduction techniques such as
		<a href="https://umap-learn.readthedocs.io/en/latest/">UMAP</a>, to create an interactive dashboard which enables a user to quickly gain an understanding of the state of current coronavirus research.  
		</p>
		<p>Our processing pipeline is built in python, and uses the <a href="https://plotly.com/dash/">dash</a> framework to display data and results to the end user.  </p>

		<b>TDA analysis of protein secondary structure</b>
		<p> As part of the Summer of Topological Data Analysis 2019, with the AFRL 711th Human Performance Wing, 
		I and my team used topological data analysis methods to predict protein secondary structure from its amino acid sequence.  </p>
		<p>The structure of a protein determines its functions and how it interacts with other molecules, and this structure is 
		determined by the interactions between the sequence of amino acids it is made of.  Determining the structure a protein will fold into
		is one of the most difficult problems in biochemistry, and an efficient and accurate predictor of protein structure would be important in 
		developing new drug treatments and biotechnology techniques.  </p>
		
		<p>Our predictor is primarily programmed in python, however other components are
		programmed in R, or make use of the <a href="https://www.ayasdi.com/">AYASDI</a> web service implementing the 
		<a href="http://danifold.net/mapper/introduction.html">mapper</a> algorithm for topological data analysis.

		<b>Minimum Effort Game</b>
		<p> Psychological experiment software implementating the Minimum Effort Game <a href="https://www.jstor.org/stable/2006745">(Van Huyck, Battalio, & Beil 1990)</a>, 
		a game of strategic interaction which simulates situations where the payoff to each person of a group is dependent on the effort expended by the 
		least-effortful player.  </p>
		<p>This game is interesting in the field of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Game_theory">game theory</a>,
		and can help in investigating human responses to game-theoretical problems, such as the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Free-rider_problem">free-rider problem.</a></p>
		<p>This implementation supports 4 players by default, and is programmed in <a href="https://www.otree.org/">oTree</a>, involving
		a combination of python, javascript, and html.</p>

	<li>
		<b>EWA model</b>
		<p> Software which models human behavior in the Minimum Effort Game, using the 
		Experience Weighted Attraction (EWA) learning model <a href="https://doi.org/10.1111/1468-0262.00054">(Camerer, & Hua Ho 1999)</a> </p>
		<p>This implementation is programmed in R, and utilizes paralellized computation, full parameter search, and hill-climbing parameter search.
		I also prepared an extensive readme to help with understanding the software and my techniques.  </p>

		<b>Academic Family Tree Visualizer</b>
		<p> An academic family tree is similar to a normal family tree, but with advisor-student relationships replacing parent-child relationships </p>
		<p> This project is comprised of a python script I wrote to <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Web_scraping">scrape</a> 
		pages off of <a href="https://academictree.org/">academictree.org</a>, and a webpage which uses the <a href="https://d3js.org/">d3.js</a> javascript library to display my own 
		academic family tree.  
		</p>
		<p>Like almost everyone in the field of psychology, my academic lineage contains such figures as 
		<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sigmund_Freud">Sigmund Freud</a>, 
		<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wilhelm_Wundt">Wilhelm Wundt</a>, 
		<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Max_Planck">Max Planck</a>, and 
		<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hermann_von_Helmholtz">Hermann von Helmholtz</a>.

		with alterations designed to manipulate the subject's experience of flow through an adaptive difficulty piece choice mechanism.  
		</p>
		<p>This experiment and related investigations of flow state as a cognitive phenomenon are the subject of my Master's thesis, expected Summer 2020.</p>

		<p>Experiment software written in the python library <a href="https://www.psychopy.org/">PsychoPy</a>,
		which implements a perceptual learning experiment for distinguishing Tetris pieces of different
		shapes and orientations.  Designed during my last semester as an undergrad researcher in Wayne Gray's

	<!-- <li> -->
		<!-- <b>	Ireland vacation panoramas</b> -->
		<!-- <p> In the summer of 2019 I went with my family on a trip to Ireland.   -->
		<!-- While there I took a number of panoramic photos, stitched them together using <a href="http://hugin.sourceforge.net/">Hugin</a>, -->
		<!-- and put together a webpage that could display them using <a href="https://pannellum.org/">pannellum</a>.</p> -->
		<!-- <p>The first two panoramas are of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Croagh_Patrick">Croagh Patrick</a>, a  -->
		<!-- mountain in County Mayo which we hiked up, and which was said to be the mountain from which St. Patrick banished all snakes from Ireland.   -->
		<!-- </p> -->
		<!-- <p>The remaining three panoramas were taken on <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Inishbofin,_County_Galway">Inishbofin</a>,  -->
		<!-- a picturesque island off the coast of Connemara, where some of my ancestors lived over 200 years ago.   -->
		<!-- </p> -->
		<!-- <p><a href="https://koneill1994.github.io/ireland_panorama/">View the panoramas!</a></p> -->

		<b>Simple JavaScript Star Simulator</b>
		<p>A cute little browser toy I made when teaching myself javascript.  
		It uses a <a href="https://www.w3schools.com/html/html5_canvas.asp"> canvas </a> element
		to draw the star field.  </p>
